__Hungry Bear__ is a python implementation of the [A-star search algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). 
The algorithm efficiently finds a path between two nodes in a graph (in this 
case a bear and a pot of honey). The algorithm is applied to the graph 
iteratively; the bear moving one node closer to the honey with each iteration.
